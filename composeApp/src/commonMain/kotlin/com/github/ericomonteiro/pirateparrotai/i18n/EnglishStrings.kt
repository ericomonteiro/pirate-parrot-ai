        Pirate-Parrot is a desktop application designed to help you during coding interviews and certification exams.
        
        It captures your screen, analyzes the content using Google's Gemini AI, and provides:
        
        • Code solutions with explanations for coding challenges
        • Correct answers with detailed explanations for certification questions
        • Time and space complexity analysis
        • Exam tips and related services
        
        The app runs in "stealth mode" - it's invisible to screen sharing and recording software.
