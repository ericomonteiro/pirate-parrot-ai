│ ElastiCache is an in-memory caching     │
│ service that provides sub-millisecond   │
│ latency. It's ideal for session storage │

│                                         │
│ A. Amazon RDS - Relational database,    │
│    higher latency than in-memory cache  │
│                                         │
│ C. Amazon S3 - Object storage, not      │
│    designed for low-latency access      │
│                                         │
│ D. Amazon EBS - Block storage for EC2,  │

│ When you see "low latency" + "session"  │
│ think ElastiCache. For "serverless"     │
│ session storage, consider DynamoDB.     │
